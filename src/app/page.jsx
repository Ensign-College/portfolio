              My name is Thomas Peterson. I am an aspiring software developer by day, and quiet meditator by night. I love learning all about technology and how it continues to evolve and
              affect the world. I'm facinated by the power of software and how it's reach can be used in so many different ways and in different industries. I'm always willing to work hard and learn new things. Thanks for visiting!
