          <p>
            As I am just starting out on my journey to become a developer, I have a few projects and aspirations in mind
            that I would like to work on and achieve at some point. Here are a few of them. Since I am just starting
            out, the main 'project' that I have completed, with a lot of help, is this website. I am very proud of it,
            and I hope to continue to improve it as I learn more.
